/*
SAFI - Anthropic Geist Inspired Redesign

This file is for any custom CSS overrides if absolutely needed beyond Tailwind CSS and inline styles in index.html.

For this redesign, most styling is handled by:
1. Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in `public/index.html`.
2. Inline `<style>` tags within `public/index.html` for specific component needs (e.g., hero SVG curve, global font settings).

No additional global CSS overrides are required in this file for the current design to maintain simplicity and reliance on the CDN.

Refer to `public/index.html` for primary styling implementations.
